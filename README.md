# Machine Learning Project Readme

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project that involves k-means clustering and supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and Naive Bayes. The dataset is clustered using Manhattan distance, and the clusters are used for a subsequent classification task.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for clustering and classification.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the code for k-means clustering and supervised learning.
- `scripts/`: Additional scripts or modules used in the project.
- `results/`: Output files, models, and any other relevant results.
- `readme.md`: Documentation and information about the project.

## Steps

### 1. K-Means Clustering

- **1.1 K-Means Clustering with Manhattan Distance:**
  - Perform k-means clustering on the dataset using Manhattan distance.

- **1.2 Extracted Labels:**
  - Add a new column 'Labels' to the dataset, filling it with cluster numbers assigned by the k-means algorithm.

### 2. Supervised Learning

- **2.1 Logistic Regression:**
  - Perform a standard classification task using logistic regression.

- **2.2 Decision Trees:**
  - Utilize decision trees for classification.

- **2.3 Random Forest:**
  - Apply random forest algorithm for classification.

- **2.4 Naive Bayes:**
  - Perform classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

### 3. Performance Comparison

- **3.1 Evaluate Models:**
  - Compare the performance of logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and Naive Bayes.

- **3.2 Cluster Homogeneity:**
  - Comment on the homogeneity of clusters obtained from k-means, and discuss whether the clusters make sense in the context of the dataset.
 
### 1. Import Breast Cancer Dataset

- **1.1 Import Breast Cancer Dataset:**
  - Use the `sklearn.datasets` library to import the breast cancer dataset.

### 2. PCA and LDA Analysis

- **2.1 PCA (2 components):**
  - Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with 2 components.

- **2.2 LDA (1 component):**
  - Perform Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with 1 component.

### 3. Visualize Components

- **3.1 Visualize PCA Components:**
  - Plot visualizations to see if PCA components can effectively segregate class labels in the breast cancer dataset.

- **3.2 Visualize LDA Component:**
  - Plot visualizations to observe the effectiveness of the LDA component in segregating class labels.

### 4. Maximum Variance Explained

- **4.1 PCA Maximum Variance:**
  - Determine the maximum variance explained by the PCA components.

- **4.2 LDA Maximum Variance:**
  - Determine the maximum variance explained by the LDA component.

### 5. Working with PCA and LDA

- **5.1 Insights into PCA:**
  - Provide comments on the working of PCA and its effectiveness for the breast cancer dataset.

- **5.2 Insights into LDA:**
  - Provide comments on the working of LDA and its effectiveness for the breast cancer dataset.

- **5.3 Comparison:**
  - Compare the performance of PCA and LDA and discuss which one is better suited for the breast cancer dataset.
